1. When launching a client, remember to set the name-flag of the client by typing "-name <name>".
2. To leave ChittyChat, just type "close" and the client will leave the server and shut down.
3. The client automatically joins the server by sending a message with the text "join" to the server. If a client types "join" after entering the chat, an error will occure where the server will broadcast once again that the client has joined.
